# Hello, World! in Every Programming Language 🌍🚀

Welcome to the **Hello, World!** repository! This project contains "Hello, World!" implementations in as many programming languages as possible. But with a twist! Instead of simply printing the text, each implementation must follow a few rules to make it a bit more interesting.  

---

## 📜 Rules for Each Implementation
To keep things consistent and slightly challenging, every implementation must:  

1. **Use a Variable** – Store `"Hello, World!"` in a variable and print it instead of hardcoding it in the output statement.  
2. **Use a Function** – Wrap the message inside a function that returns or prints it.  
3. **Follow Language Best Practices** – Use typical naming conventions, indentation, and style guides for each language.  
4. **Explore Unique Features** *(Optional but encouraged!)* – If a language has unique syntax or features, feel free to showcase them in your implementation.
